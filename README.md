# Archrice

This repository contains my personal scripts and various configuration files for Arch Linux with the i3 window manager.


# Scripts

Here is the description of some of the most relevant scripts:

- arch-install-helper: automate the setup after a clean Arch Linux installation. It sets up important packages, an AUR helper, a locking system as well as all the configurations present in `dots/`.
- texsilent: automate the compilation of LaTeX document. The compilation is silent meaning it removes auxiliary files created
during the compilation.
- mdcompile: compile markdown document, either to standard PDF or presentation slides (beamer markdown).
- autolayout: detect the monitors available (native or external) and set up the layout and sound accordingly.
- lockhook: setup a hook that detect when the system is idle, suspending and locking the system if it is.
- fl: efficient file launcher using fzf.
- gch: automatically pull all relevant git repositories in parallel.
- 0x0: Easily share files through internet, just go to the produced ip adress to download the uploaded file.
